PythonPortScanner
=================

I wrote this simple scanner trying to teach myself Python. Why port scanner?

I just wanted to do something more than a Zork clone. It scans over TCP and has no options as it was never meant to be feature-rich. Initially I wrote it on on Linux machine where I had nice coloured text formatting which, on Windows, works only in PowerShell so I removed it :(
